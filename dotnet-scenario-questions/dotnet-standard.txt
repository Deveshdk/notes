✅ What is .NET Standard?
.NET Standard is a specification (not a runtime or framework) that defines a set of common APIs that every .NET platform must implement.

In simple words:
.NET Standard is a contract that ensures code sharing across different .NET platforms.

If you target .NET Standard, your library can run on:
    .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin / Mobile, Unity, Mono, UWP

🎯 Why .NET Standard Was Created?
    Before .NET Standard, platforms had incompatible APIs:
    .NET Framework had one set
    .NET Core had another
    Xamarin had another
    This made code-sharing difficult.

.NET Standard solved this by providing a unified API surface that all platforms must support.

🎚️ Different Versions of .NET Standard
Higher versions = more APIs
But also = fewer platforms support it

Examples:
.NET Standard Version	Supported By
1.0 – 1.6	Very basic APIs, wide platform support
2.0	Most widely used, nearly complete API
2.1	More APIs, but not supported by .NET Framework
🌟 Common Interview Example

If you build a class library targeting .NET Standard 2.0, it can run on:
    .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Framework 4.6.1+, Xamarin, Mono, Unity

💡 Example
Targeting .NET Standard in a library:
<TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>


This means:
Your library uses only APIs defined in .NET Standard 2.0
Any runtime that implements .NET Standard 2.0 can run your code

🔥 Important Note (For Interviews)
“.NET Standard is now mostly replaced by .NET 5+ unified platform, but it is still important for cross-platform libraries, especially those needing compatibility with older .NET Core or .NET Framework systems.”

🎤 Interview-Ready Answer (Short Version)
    “.NET Standard is a specification that defines a common set of APIs for all .NET platforms.
    It ensures that libraries can be shared across .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, and other runtimes.
    It’s not a runtime, but a contract that guarantees compatibility.”
