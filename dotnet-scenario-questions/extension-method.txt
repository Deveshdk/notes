Extension methods are a C# feature that lets you add new methods to an existing class without modifying the original class or creating a derived class.

They allow you to “extend” the functionality of any type — even built-in ones like string, int, or third-party classes.

✅ Simple Definition (Interview-Friendly)

Extension methods are static methods that appear to be instance methods on existing types.
They use the this keyword in the first parameter to specify which type they extend.

✅ Real Example: Extension Method for String
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool IsCapitalized(this string value)
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) && char.IsUpper(value[0]);
    }
}

Usage:
bool result = "Hello".IsCapitalized();   // true


Looks like a built-in string method → but it’s your custom method.

✅ Rules (Frequently Asked in Interviews)

Must be inside a static class

Must be a static method

First parameter must have this before the type being extended

Extension methods do not modify the original type

If a class already has a method with the same signature, that one takes priority over the extension method

🔥 Why are extension methods used? (Interview Points)

✔ To add helper/utility methods
✔ To extend sealed classes (e.g., string, DateTime)
✔ To keep the code cleaner
✔ Used heavily in LINQ (e.g., Where(), Select())
✔ Create reusable functionality across the project

📌 Real Example: Extension Method for List<T>
public static class ListExtensions
{
    public static void PrintAll<T>(this List<T> list)
    {
        foreach (var item in list)
            Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
}


Usage:

var numbers = new List<int> {1, 2, 3};
numbers.PrintAll();

💡 Common Interview Question
❓ Can extension methods override existing methods?

No.
If the original type has a method with the same name and signature, that method always wins.
